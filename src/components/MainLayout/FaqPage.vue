Consider us the best place to buy Instagram followers."},
                  {question : "Is having many followers on my profile help to attract organic engagement?",  answer: "Yes! When you have many real and active followers on your profile, it appears like you're a local celebrity, and people notice that. For this reason, a user who has many followers that are legit will attract the attention of potential organic followers."},
                  {question : "How long will it take for me to receive my followers?",  answer: "That depends on stock conditions and how many followers you wish to get. While typing in the number you want to receive, you will see the estimated time beside it."},

                  {question : "Is it possible to be issued a refund?",  answer: "The only circumstance in which you will receive a refund is when we do not deliver your order within the given time in which you first placed your order. However, if your order has been delivered promptly and completely, we will not issue a refund."},
                  {question : "Why is it that my account needs to be set to public?",  answer: "To successfully send you followers, likes, and comments, our system must have access to your profile and can only have that access if it is set to public."},

What should I do?",  answer: "For first don't worry , we deliver all our orders. You must do is verify whether your account is set to public or private.
